                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            video_note (``str`` | ``BinaryIO``):
                Video note to send.
                Pass a file_id as string to send a video note that exists on the Telegram servers,
                pass a file path as string to upload a new video note that exists on your local machine, or
                pass a binary file-like object with its attribute ".name" set for in-memory uploads.
                Sending video notes by a URL is currently unsupported.

                .. note::
                    When uploading from local file: if the file is larger than 10 MB, Telegram will upload
                    it as a regular video instead of a video note.

            duration (``int``, *optional*):
                Duration of sent video in seconds.

            length (``int``, *optional*):
                Video width and height.

            thumb (``str`` | ``BinaryIO``, *optional*):
                Thumbnail of the video sent.
                The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size.
                A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320 pixels.
                Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            message_thread_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier for the target message thread (topic) of the forum.
                For forums only.

            direct_messages_topic_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of the topic in a channel direct messages chat administered by the current user.

            effect_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of the message effect.

                Describes reply parameters for the message that is being sent.

            schedule_date (:py:obj:`~datetime.datetime`, *optional*):

            view_once (``bool``, *optional*):
                Self-Destruct Timer.
                If True, the video note will self-destruct after it was viewed.

            business_connection_id (``str``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of the business connection on behalf of which the message will be sent.

            allow_paid_broadcast (``bool``, *optional*):
                If True, you will be allowed to send up to 1000 messages per second.
                Ignoring broadcasting limits for a fee of 0.1 Telegram Stars per message.
                The relevant Stars will be withdrawn from the bot's balance.

            paid_message_star_count (``int``, *optional*):

            suggested_post_parameters (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.SuggestedPostParameters`, *optional*):
                Information about the suggested post.

            reply_markup (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.InlineKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardRemove` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ForceReply`, *optional*):
                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,
                instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

            progress (``Callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` | ``None``: On success, the sent video note message is returned, otherwise,
            in case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop_transmission`, None is
            returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Send video note by uploading from local file
                await app.send_video_note("me", "video_note.mp4")
