                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            instead.

            instead.

                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.

            instead.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                await message.reply_voice(voice)

        Parameters:
            voice (``str``):
                Audio file to send.
                Pass a file_id as string to send an audio that exists on the Telegram servers,

                pass a file path as string to upload a new audio that exists on your local machine.

            quote (``bool``, *optional*):
                If ``True``, the message will be sent as a reply to this message.
                If *reply_parameters* is passed, this parameter will be ignored.

            caption (``str``, *optional*):
                Voice message caption, 0-1024 characters.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`):
                List of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

            duration (``int``, *optional*):
                Duration of the voice message in seconds.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            message_thread_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of a message thread to which the message belongs.
                For forums only.

            direct_messages_topic_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of the topic in a channel direct messages chat administered by the current user.
                For directs only.

            effect_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of the message effect.
                For private chats only.

                Describes reply parameters for the message that is being sent.

            view_once (``bool``, *optional*):
                Self-Destruct Timer.
                If True, the voice note will self-destruct after it was listened.

            business_connection_id (``str``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of the business connection on behalf of which the message will be sent.

            allow_paid_broadcast (``bool``, *optional*):

                Ignoring broadcasting limits for a fee of 0.1 Telegram Stars per message.
                The relevant Stars will be withdrawn from the bot's balance.
                For bots only.

            paid_message_star_count (``int``, *optional*):
                The number of Telegram Stars the user agreed to pay to send the messages.

            suggested_post_parameters (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.SuggestedPostParameters`, *optional*):
                Information about the suggested post.

            reply_markup (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.InlineKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardRemove` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ForceReply`, *optional*):
                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,
                instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

            progress (``Callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            On success, the sent :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` is returned.
            In case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned
            instead.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.

                Defaults to ``True`` in group chats and ``False`` in private chats.

            timeout (``int``, *optional*):
                Timeout in seconds.

            request_write_access (``bool``, *optional*):

                By default, all files are downloaded in the *downloads* folder in your working directory.
                You can also specify a path for downloading files in a custom location: paths that end with "/"
                are considered directories. All non-existent folders will be created automatically.

            in_memory (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to download the media in-memory.
                A binary file-like object with its attribute ".name" set will be returned.
                Defaults to False.

            block (``bool``, *optional*):
                Blocks the code execution until the file has been downloaded.
                Defaults to True.

            progress (``Callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.
